I want to write documentation for the `boolean` export in @/src/builder/boolean.ts , the `boolean` export is documented with JSDoc, I want you to:

1. create a docs/reference.md file if it does not exist
2. add a boolean section in there
3. put the usage examples from the jsdoc in the reference.md `boolean` section

Can you do that for me ?
